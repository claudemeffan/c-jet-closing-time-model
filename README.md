# cFET-closing-time-model
Written by Claude Meffan and Daniel Mak. 2021.

"closing_time_theoretical_model.ipynb" numerical simulates the closing time of the off-valve capillary action field effect transistor or cFET. 
The parameters can be adjusted to test different trigger channel geometries, however the ipynb is not written to robustly accept any input - take care, and ensure that you understand the data being input to ensure a correct result.
